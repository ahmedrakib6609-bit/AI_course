Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It's a field of computer science that develops methods and software enabling machines to perceive their environment and act to achieve defined goals.

In my opinion, AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, with the potential to revolutionize nearly every aspect of human life. While it presents incredible opportunities for progress and innovation, it also raises significant ethical concerns and challenges that society must address thoughtfully.

data: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn, reason, perceive, and act. Subjectively, AI offers transformative potential across industries but also raises critical ethical concerns regarding bias, privacy, and societal impact, requiring careful development and deployment.
